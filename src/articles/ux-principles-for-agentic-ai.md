title: 'UX Principles for Agentic AI'
summary: 'Agentic systems require different UX patterns than assistive AI. Design principles must adapt when users delegate tasks to systems that act with autonomy.'
intro: |
  <p>Conventional AI is assistive and reactive: the user drives, the system responds. Agentic AI is autonomous and proactive: the system takes initiative, executes multi-step tasks, and makes decisions on the user's behalf.</p>
  <p>That shift demands different design patterns. Recent UX writing on agentic AI surfaces principles that help teams apply the domain model—and avoid treating agentic systems as if they were smarter chatbots.</p>
