title: 'Agent-Driven Development Needs Operating Discipline'
summary: 'Recent SourceTMS writing centers on agent operating discipline, context architecture, and the rising importance of human direction quality in AI-assisted development.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - architecture
  - ux
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'His posts connect agent tooling patterns with architecture choices and the human factors that shape final product quality.'
classification_rationale: 'The core topic is agent-driven software workflow. Secondary domains capture repo architecture and product-direction implications.'
intro: |
  <p>Across recent SourceTMS posts, Thomas Schlossmacher keeps returning to a consistent thesis: AI coding outcomes improve when teams treat agents as systems to operate, not black boxes to prompt once.</p>
  <p>His writing combines tactical setup advice (CLAUDE.md, context hygiene, scoped execution) with a broader claim that human judgment and communication become more valuable as implementation is delegated.</p>

reading_intro: 'These sources capture Schlossmacher’s practical guidance on agent workflows and his perspective on how human value shifts in AI-native development.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">If this trajectory holds, the differentiator is less “who can write code fastest” and more “who can define intent, constraints, and quality bars clearly enough for agents to execute reliably.”</p>
