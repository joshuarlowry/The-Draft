title: "Plan First or Lose Control: Why AI Coding Requires Deliberate Planning"
intro: |
  <p>AI coding tools are not neutral executors. They interpret intent, fill gaps, and make confident decisions when instructions are incomplete. That makes them powerful—but it also means skipping a planning step does not save time. It transfers authority.</p>

  - engineer-judgment
