title: 'Plan First or Lose Control: Why AI Coding Requires Deliberate Planning'
date: 2026-02-03
summary: 'Planning-first workflows keep AI coding aligned with human intent by making decisions explicit before implementation begins.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - architecture
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Planning-first is an architectural discipline: explicit design before implementation, boundaries before delegation.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is AI coding workflows and planning. Architecture secondary for design authority and boundaries.'
intro: |
  <p>AI coding tools are not neutral executors. They interpret intent, fill gaps, and make confident decisions when instructions are incomplete. That makes them powerful—but it also means skipping a planning step does not save time. It transfers authority.</p>
  <p>Plan mode is how developers keep design decisions explicit, reviewable, and human-owned before code locks them in.</p>

reading_intro: 'The articles and papers below provide additional context around planning, human judgment, and AI-assisted development. They are grouped by theme rather than position; agreement with every conclusion is not required to find them useful.'

  <p class="reading-conclusion">These readings reinforce a common theme:<br>
  better outcomes come from deliberate thinking before execution—regardless of whether the work is done by a human, an AI, or both.</p>
