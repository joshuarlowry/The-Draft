title: 'Developer Enablement With AI: What Has Changed Recently'
date: 2026-02-11
summary: 'The conversation has shifted from model access to workflow reliability, oversight systems, and organizational readiness.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - architecture
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Reliable AI-assisted delivery is now an architectural and operating-model problem, not only a tooling problem.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is the current state of AI-assisted developer enablement. Architecture is secondary because system design and governance now shape outcomes.'
intro: |
  <p>A year ago, many discussions about AI in development centered on basic capability: could these tools write useful code at all?</p>
  <p>Now the center of gravity has moved. The practical challenge is not access to model output, but building team workflows that consistently turn that output into reliable software.</p>

reading_intro: 'These readings provide a current-state survey of how AI-assisted development is evolving from novelty to operating discipline.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">The latest wave of evidence points to the same conclusion: AI capability has advanced, but developer enablement now depends on planning quality, review systems, and guardrails that scale with output.</p>
