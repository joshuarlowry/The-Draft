title: 'AI Org Design for Agentic Teams'
summary: 'The next org chart is less about hierarchy and more about who supervises agents, owns escalation paths, and keeps quality gates intact.'
primary_domain: architecture
secondary_domains:
  - agentic
  - ux
perspective: architect
overlap_angle: 'As agentic execution scales, architecture defines operating constraints while UX ensures those systems remain legible and trustworthy to humans.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is organizational architecture under AI pressure. Agentic is secondary because coordinated agents drive the shift; UX is secondary because human trust and clarity depend on interaction design.'
intro: |
  <p>Many teams still talk about AI adoption as a tooling decision. The evidence increasingly suggests it is an org design decision.</p>
  <p>When agents execute more workflow, leaders have to redesign supervision layers, decision rights, and escalation routes so speed does not outpace accountability.</p>

reading_intro: 'These readings map the shift from AI experimentation to operating-model redesign: structure, supervision, and guardrails have to evolve together.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">AI-native org design is not a future-state thought exercise. It is an immediate systems question: who is in charge of quality when output scales faster than line-by-line review?</p>
