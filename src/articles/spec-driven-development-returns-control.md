title: 'Spec-Driven Development Returns Control to the Team'
summary: 'Spec-driven development re-centers decisions and intent by turning specs into the shared source of truth before AI implementation begins.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - architecture
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Specs as source of truth are an architectural pattern: shared boundaries and intent before implementation.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is spec-driven AI workflows. Architecture secondary for control systems and shared intent.'
intro: |
  <p>Spec-driven development reframes AI coding as a planning-first workflow. Instead of letting code shape requirements retroactively, teams capture intent, tradeoffs, and constraints before the model starts writing.</p>
  <p>That shift is as much about oversight as it is about speed: a spec makes decisions explicit, reviewable, and owned by the people accountable for the system.</p>

reading_intro: 'The sources below provide additional context on spec-first workflows, AI oversight, and the planning discipline that makes AI output reliable.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">Spec-driven development is ultimately a control system: it gives teams a shared narrative about what they are building and why, before any model locks in the implementation.</p>
