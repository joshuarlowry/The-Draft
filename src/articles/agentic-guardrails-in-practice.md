title: 'Agentic Guardrails in Practice'
date: 2026-02-03
summary: 'Multi-agent workflows turn oversight into a repeatable system by dividing intent, retrieval, and validation across roles.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - ux
  - architecture
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Guardrails and oversight are architectural concerns; UX governs how humans experience and trust agentic systems.'
classification_rationale: 'Core focus is agentic workflows, planning, and tooling guardrails. Secondary overlap with architecture (governance, system design) and UX (human oversight, trust).'
intro: |
  <p>Agentic workflows can speed delivery, but they also amplify small mistakes. Planning and role clarity are what keep that speed from becoming chaos.</p>
  <p>Guardrails that combine deliberate planning with automated checks are how teams keep control as agents take on more of the execution.</p>

reading_intro: 'These sources connect planning discipline with the tooling guardrails that keep AI-assisted workflows reliable.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">Agentic systems scale output. Guardrails make sure they also scale responsibility.</p>
