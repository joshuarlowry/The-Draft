title: 'Oversight Is the Real Skill AI Demands From Engineers'
date: 2026-02-02
summary: 'As AI output scales, oversight shifts from line-by-line review to systems, governance, and guardrails that preserve accountability.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - architecture
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Oversight at scale is an architectural concern: systems, governance, and boundaries that preserve accountability.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is AI-assisted development and oversight. Architecture secondary for governance and scalable systems.'
intro: |
  <p>A common rule of thumb in AI-assisted development is that engineers must read and understand every line of code produced by an AI. That rule sounds prudent. It is also increasingly unrealistic.</p>
  <p>As AI systems move beyond autocomplete into multi-file changes, refactors, and agent-driven workflows, the volume and abstraction level of generated code exceed what line-by-line review can reasonably guarantee.</p>

reading_intro: 'These readings provide additional context on AI-assisted development, oversight, and governance. They are grouped by theme rather than position.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">Oversight does not mean reading every line. It means designing systems that keep accountability intact as output scales.</p>
