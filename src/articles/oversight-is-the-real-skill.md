title: 'Oversight Is the Real Skill AI Demands From Engineers'
intro: |
  <p>A common rule of thumb in AI-assisted development is that engineers must read and understand every line of code produced by an AI. That rule sounds prudent. It is also increasingly unrealistic.</p>

  <p class="reading-conclusion">Oversight does not mean reading every line. It means designing systems that keep accountability intact as output scales.</p>
