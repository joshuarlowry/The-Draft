title: 'Recent UX and IA Signals: Beyond NN/g, with Jared Spool'
summary: 'Recent UX/IA signals from Jared Spool and selected NN/g pieces reinforce the same pattern: use AI to widen coverage, but keep strategic judgment and user-validated structure in control.'
primary_domain: ux
secondary_domains:
  - ia
  - agentic
perspective: hybrid
overlap_angle: 'UX practice and IA structure share one challenge: integrating AI acceleration without surrendering evidence quality or strategic direction.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary domain is UX because the article centers on research and leadership decisions. IA and agentic are secondary because structure design and AI operations are tightly coupled in implementation.'
intro: |
  <p>The earlier draft leaned too heavily on NN/g. This update broadens the source base with recent Jared Spool writing from Center Centre and then pairs it with selected NN/g method pieces.</p>
  <p>The synthesis is consistent across sources: strategic UX direction first, explicit measurement second, scalable AI methods third.</p>

reading_intro: 'These readings combine Jared Spool on strategic UX posture with practical method guidance on interview depth and IA structure.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">AI can accelerate UX and IA execution, but teams still need strategic leadership, measurement discipline, and user-centered IA evidence to keep speed aligned with outcomes.</p>
