title: 'Guardrails Are Tooling, Not Meetings'
intro: |
  <p>Guardrails for AI-assisted development are often described as policy. In practice, they work best when they are embedded in the tooling and workflows that shape every change.</p>
  <p>Static analysis, automated tests, and multi-agent workflows turn oversight into repeatable checks that scale with output.</p>
blocks:
  - oversight-guardrails
  - guardrail-static-analysis
  - guardrail-automated-testing

  - tooling-guardrails
reading_intro: 'These readings highlight how guardrails move from policy into technical workflows, from scanning to multi-agent validation.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">Guardrails are strongest when they are built into the system. The most effective oversight happens automatically, before problems reach production.</p>
