title: 'AI Enables Rapid Functional Prototyping'
date: 2026-02-03
summary: 'AI-assisted development shortens time-to-first-build, enabling teams to iterate on functional prototypes and run lightweight usability checks before deeper user research.'
primary_domain: agentic
secondary_domains:
  - ux
perspective: technologist
overlap_angle: 'Rapid prototyping with AI compresses build cycles; UX methods (heuristic evaluation, user research) remain the validation loop.'
classification_rationale: 'Primary focus is AI-assisted development and prototyping tooling. Strong UX overlap via heuristic evaluation and user research integration.'
intro: |
  <p>AI development tools collapse the distance between idea and working software. That shift makes functional prototypes easier to build, easier to iterate, and more useful as early learning instruments.</p>
  <p>The goal is not to skip user research—it’s to arrive at user sessions with higher-fidelity concepts that have already been stress-tested through rapid build and heuristic review.</p>

reading_intro: 'These sources highlight how AI shortens build cycles and how heuristic evaluation provides a fast usability filter before user testing.'
outro: |
  <p class="reading-conclusion">AI makes it possible to test functional ideas sooner, but the core loop still ends with real user feedback. The advantage is arriving there faster, with clearer hypotheses to validate.</p>
