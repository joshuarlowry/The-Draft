Recent field reports suggest that the upside is less about replacing all people and more about changing where people sit in the loop. Brandon Hall describes a three-person support team handling ticket volume that previously required 25 people while preserving service outcomes.[[cite:brandon_hall_3_person_team_quote]]

Forethought reports a similar pattern: the teams using agentic AI posted stronger deflection and the highest customer satisfaction in their cohorts.[[cite:forethought_small_teams_csat_quote]]

Bain’s banking example makes the operating model explicit: human workers moved into supervisory roles while coordinated agent squads handled workflow execution, reducing time and effort by more than 50%.[[cite:bain_bank_50_percent_reduction_quote]] The performance jump appears when organizations redesign for supervision and exception handling, not when they simply bolt chat tools onto existing process maps.
