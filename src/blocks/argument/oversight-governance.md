Oversight is becoming explicit in governance policies, not in an expectation of exhaustive comprehension. A 2025 ADTMag survey reported that 93% of technology leaders said AI-generated code undergoes human review before integration.[[cite:adtmag_human_review_quote]] That statistic signals accountability, but not necessarily line-by-line certainty.

Leaders are increasingly defining review checkpoints, required ownership, and automated checks that bound risk. The point is not to memorize every generated detail. The point is to ensure that the right people approve the right kinds of changes with the right evidence.

Review still exists. It just lives inside a broader governance system that includes CI checks, security scanning, and rapid rollback.
