The AI conversation has moved. In many teams, the question is no longer whether developers can access powerful models. The harder question is whether organizations can convert model output into dependable production outcomes.

DORA captures that shift directly: AI is an amplifier of existing organizational capabilities, not a shortcut that replaces them.[[cite:dora_ai_amplifier_quote]]

Developer sentiment data points in the same direction. Stack Overflow's 2024 survey shows broad favorability toward AI tools, but lower favorability than the prior year, indicating that real-world usage has exposed practical limits and tradeoffs.[[cite:stackoverflow_2024_ai_favorability_quote]]

And governance patterns are adapting accordingly. Technology leaders report high rates of human review before AI-generated code reaches production, signaling that mature adoption is increasingly defined by review systems and accountability boundaries.[[cite:adtmag_human_review_quote]]

Put together, these signals suggest a clear enablement reset: model capability is now baseline; workflow design is the differentiator.
