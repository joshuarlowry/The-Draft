The old pyramid chart is being pressured from both ends. PwC describes an emerging “diamond-shaped structure” with fewer entry roles, denser capability in the middle, and flatter execution paths.[[cite:pwc_no_more_pyramids_generalist_quote]]

At the same time, manager responsibilities are widening to include agent oversight. CIO reports that 28% of managers are already planning to hire people who can lead hybrid human-AI teams.[[cite:cio_microsoft_human_agent_ratio_quote]]

This is not just a hiring trend; it is a structural shift. IMD projects a 10–20% reduction in traditional middle-management roles built around information routing and basic coordination.[[cite:imd_middle_management_reduction_quote]] Teams still need leadership, but increasingly around orchestration quality, decision rights, and escalation design rather than status transmission.
