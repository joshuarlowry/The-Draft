The main benefit of planning first is not that the plans improve over time. Each plan is tied to a specific unit of work and is largely disposable.

What improves is the engineer.

Writing a plan forces articulation of intent, constraints, and tradeoffs before execution. Repeating that process sharpens judgment: what must be decided up front, what can be deferred, and where ambiguity creates risk.

This aligns with what we know about how expertise develops:

Plan mode creates that reflective loop. The AI does not need to remember anything for this to work. The learning happens on the human side.

Encoding long-term guidance or institutional memory is a separate problem with its own solutions. Plan mode is simpler and more immediate: for each piece of work, it ensures design decisions are made consciously rather than implicitly.

Planning first does not make the AI smarter.
It makes the engineer more deliberate.
