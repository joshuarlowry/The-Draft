Teams that insist engineers must read and fully understand every AI-generated line will face one of two outcomes: velocity collapses, or the rule is quietly ignored. The more common pattern is a compromise: AI output still goes through human review, but oversight becomes selective and risk-based rather than line-by-line scrutiny. [[cite:adtmag_human_review_quote]]

That shift makes leadership responsibility clear. Oversight has to become a skill: framing problems clearly, setting constraints, validating outcomes, and recognizing when AI output is drifting from intent. Research on human-centered AI practices shows that structured inputs and explicit constraints improve results and reduce reliance on generic assumptions. [[cite:arxiv_human_centered_practices_quote]]

The uncomfortable implication is unavoidable: organizations must decide whether they will invest in that oversight capability deliberately or let it emerge inconsistently by accident.
