Matt Westcott argues that command-line access is the most powerful tool for LLMs and highlights the terminal with a persistent filesystem as an overlooked but potent interface for agentic work.[[cite:give_your_llm_a_terminal_power_quote]][[cite:give_your_llm_a_terminal_filesystem_quote]]

He contrasts this with pixel-based computer use, which remains slow and error-prone for text-heavy tasks. That gap explains why terminal-first interfaces match LLM strengths in text parsing, scripting, and iterative work.[[cite:give_your_llm_a_terminal_pixel_quote]]
