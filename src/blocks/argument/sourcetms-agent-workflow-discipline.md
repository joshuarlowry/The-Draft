Thomas Schlossmacher frames agentic coding quality as an operations problem, not a model magic problem.

His workflow advice starts with scope control before execution:

[[cite:sourcetms_isolate_scope_quote]]

He then connects reliability to repo ergonomics and context efficiency:

[[cite:sourcetms_optimize_for_agents_quote]]

The same pattern shows up in his setup guidance, where persistent project instructions become baseline infrastructure:

[[cite:sourcetms_claude_md_structure_quote]]

Taken together, his argument is that teams get better agent output when they make structure explicit and repeatable.
