NVIDIA’s developer guidance highlights that agents can be trained to learn new command-line interfaces while operating safely, using verifiable, human-in-the-loop command execution patterns.[[cite:nvidia_cli_agent_new_cli_quote]][[cite:nvidia_cli_agent_human_loop_quote]]

Meanwhile, CLI-first tooling like LLM positions the terminal as a primary access layer to multiple model providers, underscoring how the ecosystem is converging on command-line workflows for agentic work.[[cite:llm_cli_tool_docs_overview_quote]]
