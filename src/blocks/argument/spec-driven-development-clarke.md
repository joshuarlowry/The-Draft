Cian Clarke frames spec-driven development as a measurable leap beyond vibe coding.

In his account, spec-driven development is the state of the art because it breaks the ceiling that limits AI output when teams stay in one-shot prompting mode:

He also emphasizes why specs change the model’s behavior: the approach forces decomposition and explicit reasoning about intent, which improves the model’s ability to deliver aligned work:

The takeaway is that specs are not just documentation; they are the lever that makes AI output more deliberate and dependable.
