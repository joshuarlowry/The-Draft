Academic work reaches the same conclusion from a different direction. The 2025 SAFE-AI framework paper warns that integrating LLMs into software engineering introduces risks such as insecure code generation, lack of transparency, and accountability gaps, and it calls for guardrails, sandboxing, runtime verification, and human-in-the-loop systems.[[cite:safe_ai_framework_quote]]

Notably, the mitigation strategy is architectural and procedural. The paper does not argue that humans must understand every generated instruction. It argues that systems must constrain, observe, and verify AI behavior.

That framing reinforces the industry trend: oversight is ownership of outcomes, not keystrokes.
