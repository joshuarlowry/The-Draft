There is a widening gap between AI enthusiasm and production discipline. McKinsey notes that while most firms are investing, fewer than 40% report meaningful bottom-line impact.[[cite:mckinsey_agentic_org_90_percent_quote]] Deloitte adds that only a small minority are actively running agentic systems in production today.[[cite:deloitte_agentic_11_percent_production_quote]]

That gap matters because structural change without execution maturity can become organizational thrash. Databricks highlights Bayer’s large management-layer reduction paired with a new decision model designed to reduce hierarchy friction.[[cite:databricks_bayer_half_management_quote]]

The lesson is that org design and operating model must move together: role boundaries, escalation policies, and quality gates need to be redesigned before headcount assumptions are locked in.
