Rapid prototyping still depends on how quickly teams can translate ideas into working software. AI code assistance materially shortens that build loop.

In a controlled experiment, GitHub found that developers using Copilot completed a programming task 55% faster than those who did not.

For prototyping, that translates into faster cycles between concept, build, and review—especially when the goal is to validate interaction flows rather than perfect architecture.
