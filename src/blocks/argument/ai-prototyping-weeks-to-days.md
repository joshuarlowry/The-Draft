AI-enabled development changes how quickly teams can reach a functional demo. Instead of waiting for full implementation or relying on static mockups, teams can ship lightweight, working prototypes early enough to learn from real interaction loops.

IDEO reported that building a lightweight LLM prototyping system reduced their time to first prototype from weeks to days, while also widening who could participate in prototyping.

The takeaway is not just speed. It’s that functional prototypes now arrive early enough to be used as learning instruments, not just validation artifacts.
