Kiro’s messaging frames spec-driven development as a way to add structure before implementation begins.

The site argues that structure belongs upfront, not after code generation starts:

It also ties spec-driven workflows to faster prototyping outcomes:

Taken together, the emphasis is on using specs to tame early-stage ambiguity and keep delivery aligned with intent.
