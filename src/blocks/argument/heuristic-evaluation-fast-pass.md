Heuristic evaluation is a structured way to review an interface against recognized usability principles before running full user research. It gives teams a rapid pass to surface obvious friction and fix it early.

[[cite:heuristic_evaluation_definition_quote]]

AI can make this pass more scalable by quickly mapping interface decisions to heuristics, but it should remain a precursor to—not a replacement for—research with real users.
