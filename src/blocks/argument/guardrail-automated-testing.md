Guardrails are most effective when they are repeatable. Testing is the simplest example: it scales when it is automated and becomes a fast feedback loop rather than a manual review.

A 2025 study on REST API testing notes that exhaustive testing is impractical and leads to gaps in coverage, which is why the researchers turn to LLMs to automate test case generation.[[cite:resttsllm_api_testing_quote]]

That point applies beyond APIs. If AI is accelerating code changes, test automation is what keeps quality and safety from falling behind. It is the guardrail that moves at the same speed as the tool.
