David Eastman frames the command line as the center of the LLM workbench, urging developers to treat the CLI as the primary surface for agentic workflows rather than a secondary tool.[[cite:learn_to_love_cli_workbench_quote]]

He also notes that CLI tasks are defined and outcome-driven, which makes them a natural fit for LLM execution loops. That framing positions terminal-first interaction as a deliberate constraint that improves reliability and focus.[[cite:learn_to_love_cli_defined_tasks_quote]]
