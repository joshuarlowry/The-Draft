Schlossmacher describes a shift where implementation effort moves toward AI while human value concentrates in steering decisions.

He makes that transfer explicit:

He also highlights a distribution effect: broader access can expand who can build, while high-skill operators still compound gains faster.

The implication is practical: teams should invest in prompting strategy, product judgment, and review discipline as core capabilities.
