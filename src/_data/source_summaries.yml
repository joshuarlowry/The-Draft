  summary: 'Google Cloud outlines practical habits for getting better AI coding results, emphasizing upfront planning, clear constraints, and tight review loops so generated code reflects real system intent rather than generic patterns.'
  long_summary: 'Google Cloud presents a set of concrete practices for using AI coding assistants responsibly, starting with clear task framing and explicit constraints. The guidance stresses that the AI should be treated like a collaborator that needs context, examples, and clear acceptance criteria to deliver useful results. It also highlights the importance of reviewing output, iterating with intent, and using automation (tests and checks) to validate AI-generated changes. The through-line is that planning and oversight are not optional add-ons—they are the inputs that keep AI output aligned with real system goals.'

  long_summary: 'This InfoQ article adapts the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) quality framework to AI code generation. It argues that teams should not treat AI output as a one-shot artifact, but rather as part of a disciplined loop that starts with a plan, proceeds to generation, and then validates results before acting on them. The piece emphasizes that verification and reflection are necessary to prevent AI-driven velocity from eroding quality, and it provides a process lens for integrating AI into established engineering practices.'

  long_summary: 'Graphite positions AI pair programming as a partnership that benefits from explicit direction. The guide underscores that the most effective results come from carefully scoped prompts, clear guardrails, and shared definitions of “done.” It encourages developers to provide surrounding context, highlight constraints, and review the output as they would a human collaborator’s work. The takeaway is that the quality of AI output depends on the quality of the context and the feedback loop that shapes it.'
